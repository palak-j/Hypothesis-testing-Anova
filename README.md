# Hypothesis-testing-Anova

If we have more than two groups, it seems that we can run multiple t tests to compare the means from different groups and if we found that at least one of the t tests was significant, we can say there is group effect. But the multiple t tests inflate Type1 error for the test of overall group effect (overall Î±).
Therefore if we have more than two groups, we will go for ANOVA test.

There are variuos forms of ANOVA such as :
#### One Way Anova
#### Two Way Anova/ Factorial Anova
#### Repeated Measures Anova
