#### Factorial Anova
A factorial Anova is any Anova that involves more than one factor (independent variable). 

To understand the relationship between independent and dependent variables, we look for different types of effects which are known as Simple effect, Main effect, and Interaction effect.

Simple effects:
This effect concern about the effect of one independent variable(IV) at a specific level of the other IV. 

Main Effects:
It is the average effect of the factors across all the levels of other IV or average effect of the levels across across all the factors.

Interaction Effects:
This effect occurs when the simple effects of one IV are not constant across all levels of the other IV.  


To conduct two-way Anova, the same general principles from one way ANOVA will apply i.e. total variability is decomposed into stable and random sources. 
Procedure for Two way Anova:
Step1: Calculate SS for each component
Step2: Calculate df for each component
Step3: Calculate MS, 
	MS = (SS/df) for each component.
Step: There will be F-tests for each component.
 	F = ratio of MScomponent to MSerror 


## Example 
Consider we randomly assign some students into three curriculums under two conditions, some with low pressure and some with high pressure. Now we have to find effects between independent and dependent variables( scores, curriculum and pressure) and run Anova test to measure effects.
