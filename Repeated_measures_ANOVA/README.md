#### Repeated Measures ANOVA
When same set of samples are being observed at different conditions, it is known as repeated measures. In this case, standard ANOVA is not appropriate because it fails to model the correlation between the repeated measures, it means the data violate the ANOVA assumption of independence. This leads to biased variance estimate and thus misleading statistical inference. 

Example1: One-way Repeated Measures ANOVA
Consider we have scores of 5 students for weekly exams (for 5 weeks) after the training.

Subject	Week1	Week2	Week3	Week4	Week5
1	      6	    10	  8	    4	    5
2	      2	    4	    8	    5   	6
3	      2   	4   	8	    5	    5
4	      4	    5   	8	    10   	7
5	      4   	7   	9	    7	    11

We want to know if there is any effect on training on the performance of students.



Example 2: Mixed Factorial Design
Consider we have data of scores of students for 4 weeks. Students are divided into two groups, first group is undergoing training and second group is control group and we want to know if this extra training affect scores of students.
